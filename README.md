# Ogg Vorbis for Windows Runtime

**vorbis-winrt** is a work in progress for a simple Windows Runtime component for decoding (so far) [Ogg Vorbis](http://xiph.org/vorbis/) files. It is being written completely in C++/CX, and is based on original C _libvorbis_ and _libvorbisfile_ libraries version 1.3.4 source code. It is available for C# and C++/CX developers writing Windows Store apps for Windows (Phone) 8.1 and higher.
